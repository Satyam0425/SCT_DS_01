Task 01 - Bar Chart Visualization (Skillcraft Technology)

This repository contains my first task from the SkillCraft Data Science Internship. The task focuses on creating a Bar Chart Visualization in Power BI to represent structured population data.

ðŸ”¹ Task Objective

To analyze and visualize dataset columns such as:

Age

Total Population

Male

Female


and highlight key insights using a clear and interactive Bar Chart.

ðŸ”¹ Tools & Technologies

Power BI Desktop

Data Cleaning & Transformation (Power Query)

Visualization Techniques


ðŸ”¹ Key Highlights

Designed a Bar Chart showing population distribution across age groups.

Highlighted gender-based differences (Male vs. Female) within each age.

Ensured clarity by excluding redundant columns like Total Population where not necessary.

Delivered a clean and professional dashboard view.


ðŸ”¹ Outcome

The final visualization provides quick insights into demographic patterns, making it easier to compare age-wise population splits between male and female groups.
